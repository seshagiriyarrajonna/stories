    <h2>The Story</h2>

    <p>
        High up in the bright blue sky lived a tiny cloud named <strong>Chotu</strong>.
        Chotu was smaller than all the other clouds and often felt left out.
        While the big clouds made huge shadows and brought rain to the fields,
        Chotu could only float around quietly.
    </p>

    <p>
        One morning, <strong>Sunbeam</strong> greeted Chotu with a warm smile.
        “Why do you look so sad?” Sunbeam asked.
        Chotu sighed, “I wish I could do something important too.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Just then, <strong>Windy</strong> swooshed by. “Come with me, Chotu!
        I’ll show you something amazing.”
        Before Chotu could reply, Windy gently pushed him across the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
        They floated over a small village where the children were playing.
        Suddenly, one of the kids pointed up and shouted,
        “Look! A cloud shaped like a bunny!”
        All the children laughed and clapped.
    </p>

    <p>
        Chotu looked at his reflection in a pond below and realized he really did
        look like a bunny. The children were delighted, and their joy made Chotu glow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sunbeam whispered, “See? Even the smallest cloud can make someone smile.”
        Chotu felt proud for the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
        From that day on, Chotu floated happily, knowing that even small things
        can bring big happiness.
